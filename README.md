Uses Express server and React client.

Run on the following commmands on the root directory to get started.

## Setup

1. `npm run p/post` Installs all packages
2. `npm run audit` Run fix audit on all packages
3. `npm run build` Creates index.html by running build
4. `npm run dev` Runs server (Port=5000) and client (Port=3000) concurrently using the "concurrently" package.
